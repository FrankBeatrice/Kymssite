# [CannaGather](https://cannagather.com/march2019/kymb)

CannaGather is the largest cannabis industry community in New York, and I am thrilled to have been part of its journey. Starting as a modest meetup in Manhattan, CannaGather has grown over the years to packing venues to the brim. Throughout its existence, CannaGather has committed to bringing a diverse array of speakers to each monthly event. Speakers include activists, investors, entrepreneurs and many others.

Today, CannaGather is expanding to locations including New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, California and more. Just like New York, these locations offer enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and everyone else the opportunity to network, learn and connect with the cannabis community.

As CannaGather’s plug for news and information, I am proud to present my segment, #CannabisWithKymB, and what you can expect at CannaGather.

## #TheRundown

Each CannaGather New York kicks off at 7 pm with a networking session, food and drinks from master mixologist Thomas LaRossa. Here, guests can tour around the tables and check out a ton of great products and services from lawyers to CBD companies, including my company [Tribe Tokes](https://tribetokes.com). Additional sponsors include BDS Analytics, Arcview and plenty of others on a one-off or a regular basis.

Around 20 minutes to 8 pm, we kick things off with news from yours truly, other updates and announcements from our sponsors. At 8 pm, our keynote speaker(s) take the stage with host Josh Weinstein to present their information and field questions from the audience. Then, we head to our nearby bar, Adoro Lei, for more networking opportunities.

## #DopeGuests

As I mentioned, CannaGather events always have a slew of speakers to satisfy everyone's canna interests. They include founders of cannabis products, like Paul Chu, a leader for companies including Weekend Unlimited, Hey Mary, Canna Candys and several others.

Government officials often drop in as well. They include Richard Carleton, CEO of the Canadian Securities Exchange. On the flip side, we've hosted prominent names in the media as well, like multi-award winning journalist John Stossel.

CannaGather also stays connected to the cannabis community by speaking with key activists in the space. They include Joy Beckerman, a founder and principal of Hemp Ace International, Director at NORML and one of my inspirations in the industry.

And be sure to let us know if you have any guests you think we should have! We’re stoked to hear about your thoughts and opinions on guests and the evening altogether.

## #GetInvolved

If you’ve been to a CannaGather NY event before, you’ll know how much I push for people to get involved. If you don’t show up, you can’t get involved. This was the case with me a few years ago when I was starting out, and continues to be the case for plenty of others.

With the industry set to boom more and more in the coming years, scores of others are ready to get into the cannabis industry. If you want to learn more, make the modest investment and come to CannaGather. If you can’t make it to New York, check out an event near you sometime soon.

Drop the CannaGather team or me a line if you have any questions. We’re happy to help. See you at an event soon!

# [NuggMD](http://kymb.nuggmd.com/)

New York State’s medical cannabis program has undergone a 180° turn for the better in the past few years. Once considered one of the most restrictive programs in the country, the state is now one of the most progressive in the country. That includes becoming one of the first few states to approve medical cannabis cards for anyone prescribed an opioid-based medication.

While progress is underway in New York, some prospective patients are still painfully far away from a certified professional who can give them the recommendation they need to participate in the market. Thankfully, telemedicine helps bridge that gap to provide patients and physicians with a solution. One of the premier names in the space is NuggMD, and they may be the answer for New Yorkers, no matter where they are in the state.

NuggMD is the fastest, easiest and most secure way to get your medical cannabis recommendation and card in the country. Their reputation, efficiency and reliability make them one of the top names for evaluations and delivery aggregation. They are also a preferred choice of many when purchasing their cannabis.

The company believes in the new behaviors and attitudes that come with the modern cannabis space. A vital component of this burgeoning new normal in cannabis is exposing misinformation and reveal the truths of these pressing situations. You can find this in action on [Nugg’s blog](https://getnugg.com/blog/) and in its customer service.

NuggMD provides these answers by facilitating easier access to information and by empowering consumers through reliable information, personalized support and attention as well as the company's conviction to putting the needs of the consumer above all else.

So far, over 25,000 people in California have placed their trust in NuggMD. And that's why I am happy to help others in the state do the same.

Those hoping to qualify need to follow NuggMD's three-step process:

1\. Complete a 30-second confidential questionnaire which is shared with one of NuggMD's doctors.

2\. Fill out your payment information. You won’t be charged until after your appointment with a doctor.

3\. You then will speak with a doctor online to answer any of your questions or concerns. Usually, the session lasts roughly five minutes.

4\. If approved, you should receive your recommendation via email shortly after your appointment.

Each NuggMD member receives the following with their purchase:

1. A 12-month recommendation for medical cannabis in California
2. A recommendation that is accepted across the state's dispensaries
3. The support patients deserve with 24/7 online verification
4. An instant PDF download of your recommendation
5. Your paper recommendation mailed the same day
6. A wallet card option for an additional price

The company's service and professionalism are second to none. Take it from Brian M, NuggMD's first-ever patient. He said that "I couldn't believe how easy the NuggMD process was. The doctor was friendly, easy going, and answered all of my questions. I was approved in about 10 minutes and I didn't even have to leave my house. Truly amazing!"

I am thrilled to [get New York patients signed up](http://kymb.nuggmd.com/) and ready to meet with their physician today. To learn more, contact the NuggMD team, or drop me a line. We’re both happy to help New Yorkers, and other qualifying states, get their recommendation and medication they deserve.
