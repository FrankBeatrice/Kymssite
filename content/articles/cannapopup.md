The best way to describe the Canna Pop-Up event is one-part social event, one-part education, one-part foodie, one-part art exhibit, and ALL parts for anyone with an open mind. Pop-up experiences last for only a brief period of time. They are transitory and as a result, exciting and compelling. 

The Canna Pop-Up experience will elevate your senses to a higher level. We bring people together to learn about cannabis for health, wellness, self-care, and caregiving. Our pop-up events will exhibit what tasteful, responsible adult use could look and feel like. 

The cannabis industry has made remarkable strides and it’s our desire to help shape the cannabis landscape in the NJ/NY area and create buzz and excitement about medical and adult-use. Until then, we have a very powerful supplement, Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis extract legal in all 50 states and is proven to have calming and stress-relieving effects, among other positive health benefits for a variety of medical and social conditions.
