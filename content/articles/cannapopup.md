**New Jersey’s First Cannabis Culture Pop-Ups - Bringing Events to a New High**

by Holli Ehrlich, Co-Producer Canna Pop-Up

Marijuana might not be legal in New Jersey YET, but everyone’s talking about the emerging cannabis market. Humans have used hemp, a variety of Cannabis sativa and a primary source of CBD, for more than 10,000 years in food, textiles and medicine. [CBD](https://cannapopup.com/what-is-cbd/) oil, or cannabidiol, is just one of a variety of extracts found in the marijuana plant and it does not contain the psychoactive properties of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the compound in cannabis that gets people high.

In 2018 Robert Allen, my partner in business and in life, and I immersed ourselves in the cannabis community learning about the legal, political, financial and medical issues surrounding this plant. We attended numerous monthly NJ/NY networking & educational meetings, panel discussions, and the [NORML](https://norml.org/) conference in Washington, DC. We met advocates, activists, doctors, nurses, pharmacologists, patients, politicians, lawyers, hundreds of lay people, entrepreneurs and professionals, people like you and me that want to be and do “something” in this space. Some are still figuring it out. Some know exactly what, like US.

[Who are Holli & Robert](https://cannapopup.com/who-we-are/)? For 27 years we have been entrepreneurs as video, podcast and event producers in the wedding/event, health/wellness and non-profit spaces. Democracy, Governor Phil Murphy’s advocacy for legalization of marijuana, the opioid crisis and Robert’s personal experience post hip-replacement in December 2017 are some of the influences that led us to founding [Canna Pop-Up](https://cannapopup.com/). We strongly believe that we should be free to choose our medicine and that includes cannabis. We learned about the science of the endocannabinoid system and heard emotional life-saving stories that CBD helps arthritis, autism, auto-immune conditions, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, fibromyalgia and Multiple Sclerosis. People are sick and tired of feeling anxious, depressed, fatigued, living with pain and inflammation. As cannapreneurs we are excited to break new ground with events dedicated to celebrating the wellness benefits of humanity’s oldest cultivated plant.

On Thursday, December 20th we created a relaxed, safe, fun environment at our [inaugural Canna Pop-Up](https://cannapopup.com/cannabis-culture-cbd-pop-up-livingston-new-jersey/) at Studio355 in Livingston NJ for adults 21+ to learn about the power of CBD. We brought together over 200 canna-curious people. Lots of questions were answered. We showcased a curated selection of innovative products and services from high-quality brands. Our [sponsors](https://cannapopup.com/cannabis-culture-cbd-pop-up-livingston-new-jersey/) sampled and sold CBD essentials, accessories, wellness and beauty products (edibles, sprays, topicals, tinctures) infused with soothing cannabidiols to ease one’s busy lifestyle. There was live music with Filthy Rich, [Sanna CBD Yoga](https://www.facebook.com/SannaCBDYoga/), infused food and beverages, [body art](http://www.notascrazyasyouthink.com/), entertainment and giveaways. VIPs received a Swag Bag full of goodies from the sponsors, infused hors d'oeuvres, and exclusive discounts. Seniors and Veterans attended for free. We donated a portion of the ticket sales to the [Epilepsy Foundation](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy) and [Livingston Animal Shelter ](http://www.livingstonnj.org/348/Animal-Control)because CBD helps pets too! Best of all we bring people together to learn about Hemp-derived CBD for health, wellness, fitness, self-care, and caregiving. As the expansion of the cannabis culture continues to become more acceptable, both legally and socially, the more there will be a need to elevate one’s understanding of what’s safe and legally available. Robert and I want to enrich your life at a Canna Pop-Up event with an experience to remember.

Each [monthly pop-up](https://cannapopup.com/pop-up-at-18-label-street/) will be different offering a unique opportunity to discover new products, entertainment, and culinary delights. Do we think we will overcome the stigma and taboos? YES. If we can deepen relationships with people and earn their trust in other areas of life, then we will be able to influence untapped communities about CBD as an ingredient, a supplement for good health. We are on a mission to to bring something we strongly believe in to those who have fallen prey to the “propaganda” against cannabis-related products. The cannabis industry is going to be growing by billions every year for the unforeseen future and we want to be front and center empowering others.

[Next Pop-Up](https://cannapopup.com/pop-up-at-18-label-street/): Thursday, March, 28 West Orange NJ. Get your tickets [HERE](https://cannapopup.com/pop-up-at-18-label-street/). Portion of ticket sales will be donated to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America ([ADAA](https://adaa.org/)).
