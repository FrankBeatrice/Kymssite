What an exciting time in the world of weed! As your official plug for news and events, I have been struggling to create a hub for all of the amazing opportunities in the cannabis community. After months of compiling and an amazing team - I launch Cannabis with KymB Online Platform. Here you can find all things cannabis specifically on the (B) East Coast.  
  
It’s no secret that I LOVE cannabis in all shapes, sizes and forms #girlwhosmokes  
  
On this site, check out all the brands and events that I love. Whether you are an advocate, patient or canna-curious, you’ll find something here for you. Join me at CannaGather or Women Grow and keepyour network poppin’. Shop the latest in CBD - coffee, beauty, fashion and more. Get information of becoming a patient of the plant with Nugg MD. I could go on and on but really you just need to start scrolling.

This site is interactive with links, love and info. Don’t be shy! HMU if you have questions or want to say hi! Follow me on instagram for a look into my life as the Director of Distribution and partner at

TribeTokes, one the sexiest girl-owned Vaping companies out there. My goal is to give you the scoop on the cannabis industry and all its glory. Remember, if you want to be part of the movement, you gotta show up and educate yourself. Thank you so much for being part of the movement.
