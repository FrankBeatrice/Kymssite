**High!**  

Welcome to Cannabis with KymB! I’m Lacey, your editor and chief and I am so glad you are here to join us in this movement! Our goal is to keep you posted on all things KymB and Cannabis related for the east coast! I’m so excited to bring you information on all the exciting things happening in the cannabis movement, especially with legalization on the horizon in so many places, my hope is to help bring you the information that you need to advocate for and educate yourself and others while also working towards breaking the stigma attached to cannabis and those that use it, whether it be medicinally or recreationally.

I’m a cannabis patient from New Jersey. I have used cannabis to improve the quality of my life, by reducing the pharmaceuticals I need to treat and manage my chronic health conditions.  Aside from my work with Cannabis with KymB, I’m also a mom, independent product reviewer and cannabis writer. I like trying new cannabis products and promoting the products use and love, while sharing my cannabis journey with others. When I can, I like to check out local cannabis events and advocate the use of cannabis. I enjoy spending time with my son and boyfriend in nature or just around the house. Check me out on Instagram @lacey_project and on Facebook LaceyProject420. I’ve been published by Honeysuckle Magazine and Cannacoop. I believe in the healing power of cannabis and the many uses the plant can serve medicinally and as a textile. I hope to be a part of the change I wish to see in the world, by changing the stereotypical face of cannabis users while shattering the stigma attached to cannabis use, especially by parents. Cannabis has changed my life and I’d like to see it more acceptable and accessible for all, improving the quality of life for all. 

Stay lifted!
