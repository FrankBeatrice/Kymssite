      <description>I find myself always wanting to start something new. I am always picking up new hobbies and skills to hone and never seem to fully master them before moving on to the next one. I sit here and ponder why?
What would cause me to be this way? I believe it&amp;rsquo;s my innate desire to teach others. To always show others how something is done. Nothing brings me more satisfaction than the fact that I could do something that would make somebody else&amp;rsquo;s life easier.</description>
