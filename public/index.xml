      <description>I hate having to setup my development environment over and over again. Today I am going to show you how to set it up once. Along with my theme of free resources, Coder.com is perfect for coding anywhere on anything.
 Installing Hugo on Coder.com Run this command in the terminal
go get -u github.com/gohugoio/hugo  Go to root/go/src/github.com/gohugoio/hugo and run a build command. Once this is done copy the hugo binary to /usr/local/bin</description>

      <description>I find myself always wanting to start something new. I am always picking up new hobbies and skills to hone and never seem to fully master them before moving on to the next one. I sit here and ponder why?
What would cause me to be this way? I believe it&amp;rsquo;s my innate desire to teach others. To always show others how something is done. Nothing brings me more satisfaction than the fact that I could do something that would make somebody else&amp;rsquo;s life easier.</description>

      <description>I have realized something about myself that took me a long time to learn. Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t like to do things unless I can see the road ahead. Where does this choice leave me? Why am I even trying?
This feels like a common trait of many people I know if not everybody. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t need a general direction to take you anywhere. That sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s best to just do something to do it.</description>
