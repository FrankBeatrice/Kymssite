      <title>Why Can&#39;t I be Consistent? </title>

      <description>I find myself always wanting to start something new. I am always picking up new hobbies and skills to hone and never seem to fully master them before moving on to the next one. I sit here and ponder why?
What would cause me to be this way? I believe it&amp;rsquo;s my innate desire to teach others. To always show others how something is done. Nothing brings me more satisfaction than the fact that I could do something that would make somebody else&amp;rsquo;s life easier.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everybody has heard of them. Everybody has most likely heard one whizzing by over their head at some point, even if you might not have known it was one. Drones are becoming very invasive in our lives today and I wanna tell you why I love them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I have realized something about myself that took me a long time to learn. Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t like to do things unless I can see the road ahead. Where does this choice leave me? Why am I even trying?
This feels like a common trait of many people I know if not everybody. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t need a general direction to take you anywhere. That sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s best to just do something to do it.</description>
