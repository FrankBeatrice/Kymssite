      <description>I have realized something about myself that took me a long time to learn. Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t like to do things unless I can see the road ahead. Where does this choice leave me? Why am I even trying?
This feels like a common trait of many people I know if not everybody. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t need a general direction to take you anywhere. That sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s best to just do something to do it.</description>
